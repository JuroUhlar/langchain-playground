"you can start with an OSS version that doesn’t need any backend and is super fast and then migrate to the Pro version if you need better accuracy, Recaptcha cannot do that"

"recaptcha cannot block traffic and can only annoy humans, with botd we can integrate (it’s in the future, but we’ll do it) with industry leading WAF solutions to not only detect bots but effectively block them."
