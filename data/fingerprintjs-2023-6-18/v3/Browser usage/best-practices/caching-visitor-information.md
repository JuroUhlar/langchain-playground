A `visitorId` generated per page view across all pages on a site can lead to unexpected and excess API usage. We recommend storing the visitorId per browser session to minimize the identifications of a visitor as they navigate your site from one browser tab.

> ðŸ“˜ Note

> Values stored in sessionStorage, localStorage, and cookies are not available from Incognito mode, so these caching attempts will not work if a visitor switches from normal to private browsing (or vice versa).

### Caching methods

#### sessionStorage

sessionStorage is one solution to cache the Fingerprint Identification `visitorId` per user session. Unlike localStorage, this property is automatically cleared when the page session ends (i.e. closing the browser tab or window).

First, perform a check whether sessionStorage contains a `visitorId` by wrapping an if statement around `fpPromise`. If `visitorId` does not exist (condition is false), perform a Fingerprint API request using the `fp.get()` method. When the promise is resolved, write the `visitorId` to sessionStorage.

#### Cookies

An alternative approach to sessionStorage is to store information by JavaScript-set cookies. The concept is similar where a check for an existing `visitorId` is performed, and if the cookie does not exist only then is a request made to Fingerprint. The difference is that cookies require an expiration date defined by the developer. We recommend storing a visitorId no longer than 24 hours.

#### Single-Page Applications

If you are using Fingerprint in a single-page application built with frameworks like React, Vue, or Angular, we recommend using our dedicated open-source packages. These wrappers offers caching options for sessionStorage or localStorage.
