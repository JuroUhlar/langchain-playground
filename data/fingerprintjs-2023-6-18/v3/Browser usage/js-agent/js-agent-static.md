The regular [NPM package of JS agent](doc:js-agent) downloads its code in runtime from our CDN. If you need an old style Node package that has all its code embedded and downloads no code in runtime, you can install the static Node package by following this guide.

We don't recommend installing the static package because it doesn't update automatically so you'll miss important updates that affect the precision.

## Limitations

The static package is accessed on the allowlist basis. Please reach [our support](mailto:support@fingerprintjs.com) to get an admission to use the package. We may block the static package on server side for those customers who hasn't got the admission.

## Installation

Only NPM installation is supported.

First, create a file named `.npmrc` in the root of your project (where the `package.json` file stays) with the following content:

```text .npmrc
@fingerprintjs:registry=https://npm.fpregistry.io
```

The file name is the same for Yarn (`.yarnrc` won't work).

Then install the static package:

```shell NPM
npm remove @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro
npm install @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-static
```
```shell Yarn
yarn remove @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro
yarn add @fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs-pro-static
```

Change the package name in the code:

```diff ECMAScript
- import FingerprintJS from '@fingerprint/fingerprintjs-pro'
+ import * as FingerprintJS from '@fingerprint/fingerprintjs-pro-static'
```
```diff CommonJS
- const FingerprintJS = require('@fingerprint/fingerprintjs-pro')
+ const FingerprintJS = require('@fingerprint/fingerprintjs-pro-static')
```

Set your [region](doc:regions) explicitly and add the necessary modules:

```diff
FingerprintJS.load({
  apiKey: <<browserToken>>,
+ region: 'us',                               // The region of your API key
+ modules: [
+   FingerprintJS.makeIdentificationModule(), // If you use identification
+   FingerprintJS.makeBotdModule(),           // If you use bot detection
+ ],
})
```

You may add the modules that you don't use, but it will harm the agent performance and weight.

> ðŸš§ 
> 
> You must change `import FingerprintJS from` to `import * as FingerprintJS from` to access the modules. Also it's good for [tree-shaking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_shaking).
