##Schedule 3

###Technical and Organisational Security Measures


**1. Introduction**

The data importer employs a combination of policies, procedures, guidelines and technical controls to protect the personal data it processes from accidental loss and unauthorised access, disclosure or destruction. 


** 2. Governance and Policies** 

The data importer has organised leadership and defined policies related to information security to ensure alignment with business objectives to adequately serve clients. These policies are reviewed and approved annually by management and updates are communicated to employees and relevant external parties. 

Roles and responsibilities for teams and team members are defined within the data importer’s organisational structure and reporting lines as well as written job descriptions. Management reviews the data importer's organisational structure at least annually as part of strategic planning, and any changes are made as needed based on changing reporting lines, authorities, and responsibilities.

The data importer has following security policies and related processes in place:

* (a) Data classification and business impact assessment

* (b) Selection, documentation, and implementation of security controls

* (c) Assessment of security controls

* (d) User access authorization and provisioning

* (e) Removal of user access

* (f) Monitoring of security controls

* (g) Security management


**3. Access control**

The data importer has implemented role-based access controls that limit access to sensitive information to only those individuals who require access based on job function, active employment, and management approval. The data importer maintains an up-to-date and complete inventory of information technology assets and asset owners.

Administrative level access to the data importer's critical systems (network, application, source code, and related databases) is limited to appropriate individuals based on job function and current employment with the data importer.

Administrative level access to critical system components including (production servers, databases, system infrastructure components, and front-end application level) are restricted to appropriate individuals based on job function and current employment with the data importer.

Access to the Amazon Web Services ("**AWS**") environment is controlled with security groups configured to prevent access based on pre-defined access control lists. Monitoring tools are in place to monitor the AWS environment and administrators receive notification of issues detected by the system based on predefined alert thresholds.

Sensitive authentication data such as service accounts and encryption keys are stored in a key management system. Access to sensitive authentication data is limited to only appropriate individuals based on job function and active employment with the data importer.

Remote access to the data importer's network and system infrastructure requires a unique username, password, and one-time multi-factor authentication code to authenticate. Remote access to the data importer's network and system infrastructure is limited to only appropriate individuals based on job function and active employment with the data importer.

Access to the data importer's systems requires a unique username and password. Password complexity standards within AWS are enforced and include the following:

* (a) Minimum password length is 16 characters
  
* (b) Require at least one uppercase letter from Latin alphabet (A–Z)

* (c) Require at least one lowercase letter from Latin alphabet (a–z)

* (d) Require at least one number

* (e) Require at least one non alphanumeric character ! @ # $ % ^ & * ( ) _ + - = [ ] { } | '.

* (f) Passwords expires in 90 days

* (g) Allow users to change their own password


**4. Segmentation of personal data**

The data importer has logically segmented its network so that unrelated portions of the information system are isolated from each other. All public internet facing systems are segregated from the production network through network segmentation, firewalling, logical access restrictions, and the use of load balancers which restricts access to production infrastructure. The data importer's information security program prohibits the use of shared user accounts unless approved by management.


**5. Encryption and Transmission **

All data classified as potentially sensitive is encrypted at the database level while at rest. All media containing sensitive data, including electronic, hardcopy, and photocopy, is destroyed when it is no longer needed for business or legal reasons as defined in the data importers' terms of service.

All data in transit is encrypted including the following:

* (a) Information transmitted over the public internet (HTTPS)

* (b) Data transferred within system components (TLS)

* (c) Data transferred between organisations (SFTP)

Access to modify data transmission protocols is limited to appropriate individuals based on job function, current employment status, and inquiry with the data importer's management team.

All authentication and data transmission to the production applications, the operating systems hosting the applications, and associated production databases take place over secure transmission channels (i.e. VPN, SSH, SFTP, TLS). All production databases are encrypted using AES-256 bit encryption.


**6. Data Backup and Recovery**

The data importer performs incremental backups of its critical information systems on a daily basis, and full backups are performed on at least a weekly basis. IT management is alerted in the case of a backup failure, and backup failures are tracked to remediation.

Established entity standards exist for infrastructure and software hardening and configurations for key system components and infrastructure. The data importer has established a business continuity plan and disaster recovery plan, both of which are reviewed, tested, and updated on an annual basis.


**7. Incident Management and System Monitoring**

The data importer's management team has implemented an incident response plan that outlines the requirements for responding to anomalies that are indicative of malicious acts, natural disasters, and errors affecting the entity's ability to meet its objectives.

Security events are documented, reviewed, and tracked to final remediation by data importer's management team. A root cause analysis is conducted to determine the cause and mitigate the risk of such an incident occurring in the future.

The data importer has security monitoring tools in place to monitor the data importer's production environment and provide an ongoing solution to monitor security threats and unusual system activities. The data importer's management team receives alerts from the tools, based on predefined thresholds, and confirmed security issues are tracked to remediation.

The data importer engages a third-party to perform external penetration tests of the system on an annual basis. Management assesses and prioritises the results of the penetration test and tracks issues of medium criticality or above to final remediation.


**8. Asset and Software Management**

The data importer has implemented a change management policy that outlines the requirements for authorization, design, development, configuration, documentation, testing, approval, and implementation of changes to infrastructure, data, and software. All system changes are tested, reviewed, and approved prior to implementation to the production environment. Access to make changes to source code is limited to only appropriate individuals based on job function and active employment with the data importer.

Version control software is in place to manage current versions of source code. Audit logs of all commits to source code libraries are maintained.

Source code scans are performed on in-scope application source code to detect potential vulnerabilities prior to the release of source code into the production environment. Any high-risk vulnerabilities are tracked to remediation prior to the promotion of each change into the production environment.


**9. Physical Security **

The data importer has a cloud-based infrastructure in AWS and relies on this subservice organisation to operate physical access controls to the data centres hosting the data importer's infrastructure. Additionally, the data importer does not own any facilities containing information assets which would require physical security controls to be implemented.


**10. Endpoint Security**

The data importer has enforced the following mobile device hardening standards for laptops and mobile phones:

* (a) Evidence of device encryption

* (b) Enterprise antivirus enabled
 
* (c) Antivirus daily updates
 
* (d) Requirement of user name and password

* (e) Patches or regular OS updates

All laptops with access to the data importer's network are configured to enforce hard drive encryption.

The data importer's security policy prohibits the use of removable media storage without prior approval from management.

Anti-virus/anti-malware software is installed on workstations and laptops supporting the system. Antivirus software is configured to receive an updated virus signature at least daily. Network operations receives a report of devices that have not been updated in more than 24 hours and follows up on those devices.


**11. Service providers**

The data importer has written contracts in place with service providers which require them to implement appropriate security measures to protect the personal data to which they have access and to limit the use of personal data in accordance with the data importer's instructions. 


**12. Customer Communications**

The data importer has reporting mechanisms in place for reporting security issues and compliance concerns from internal and external system users. Each report is reviewed by appropriate management personnel, based on the nature of the suspected security issues, in accordance with the data importer's Incident Response Policy.

Security incidents and unauthorised disclosures of internal or external user data are communicated to data subjects, relevant legal and regulatory authorities, and others as required by law, contract, or at the advice of legal counsel, per the incident response plan.

Customer responsibilities, which include responsibility for reporting operational failures, incidents, problems, concerns, and complaints, and the process for doing so, are described within customer agreements. The Company communicates relevant security and privacy commitments, made available on its public-facing website or by written request.

When major changes to security or privacy commitments are made, the Company communicates these changes to impacted stakeholders via email.

System descriptions are made available to authorised external users that delineate the boundaries of the system and describe relevant system components as well as the purpose and design of the system.


**13. Staff training and awareness**

The data importer maintains security policies and procedures which communicate objectives and responsibilities for internal control, necessary to support the function of internal control. Policies and procedures are made available to employees in the data importer's policy document repository.

The data importer has established standards and guidelines for management's, employees', and contractors' ethical behaviour, as outlined in the data importer's employee handbook. The handbook includes a termination policy for personnel who violate the data importer's policies and procedures, which may include disciplinary action up to and including involuntary termination.

All employees and contractors are required to sign an employment agreement that requires personnel to adhere to the data importer's code of conduct, security, and confidentiality policies and procedures as part of their initial terms and conditions of employment.

The data importer has implemented a formal disciplinary process to address instances of noncompliance with the data importer's standards of conduct related to security which includes disciplinary measures up to and including termination.

Roles and responsibilities are defined by written job descriptions and communicated to the data importer's employees upon hire, as well as to their managers and supervisors.

Management monitors personnel compliance with the code of conduct through a complaint submission system which serves as a mechanism for reporting deviations from the code of conduct. Any deviations to the code of conduct are addressed immediately in accordance with the employee handbook.
