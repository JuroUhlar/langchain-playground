- Increased stability of the audio fingerprint component on iPhone
- Made JS agent use a TLS server located in Europe when the region is set to EU, for example:
    ```js
    FingerprintJS.load({
      token: 'your-token',
      region: 'eu'
    })
    ```
- Added an option to set a custom TLS endpoint:
    ```js
    FingerprintJS.load({
      token: 'your-token',
      tlsEndpoint: 'https://mytls.example.com'
    })
    ```
