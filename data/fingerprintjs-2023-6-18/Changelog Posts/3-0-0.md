- The JS agent API is changed to provide a simple transition from the [open-source version of the agent](https://github.com/fingerprintjs/fingerprintjs).
- The installation methods have been unified so that they have same options and same usage methods. Also we've added a couple new ways to install.
- Result and error handling has been simplified. A single value type is returned (resolved) and a single value type is thrown (rejected). The agent throws error only when a visitor identification fails due to incorrect agent setup or network issues; special kinds of visitors don't cause errors.
