- Improve incognito mode detection accuracy in Safari
- Deprecate the `ipResolution` parameter because it affects nothing
- The `get()` result's `ipLocation` field is marked is optional in the TypeScript declaration. The field could be undefined in fact, so this is a fix of the type declaration.
- Actualize [the list of supported browsers](doc:browser-support)
- A new [error code](doc:js-agent#error-handling) for cases when the JS agent version is not supported: `FingerprintJS.ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_VERSION`
- Decrease the JS agent code size by removing legacy parts
- fix: An indefinite `setTimeout` loop in Firefox
