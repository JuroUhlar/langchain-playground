- fix: It's impossible to set an endpoint that is relative to the current domain in the `FingerprintJS.load()` function. For example, the following code didn't work:

    ```js
    const fp = await FingerprintJS.load({ token: 'your-token', endpoint: '/metrics' })
    const result = await fp.get()
    ```
    Warning. If you set the `endpoint` option to something like `metrics.example.com`, it will break because this is not an expected behavior. Change the endpoint to `https://metrics.example.com`.
