- A new CDN for the CDN installation methods. Follow [this guide](doc:migrating-from-pro-v3#cdn) to update. The old CDN URLs pointing to jsDelivr continue working, but we recommend switching to our CDN to avoid excess network requests.
- JS agent installed from NPM loads its code from our CDN in runtime. It guarantees that you always use the latest and the most accurate version of JS agent.
    - If you use a Content Security Policy, add the CDN domain to the CSP as described [here](doc:js-agent-csp) (see the "NPM installation" tab).
    - If you do an HTML preconnect, consider preconnecting to the CDN too as described [here](doc:api-preconnect) (see the "NPM installation" tab).
- Add `firstSeenAt` and `lastSeenAt` fields to JS agent responses. See more details in [the useful timestamps guide](doc:useful-timestamps).
- New error types: `ERROR_SCRIPT_LOAD_FAIL` and `ERROR_INSTALLATION_METHOD_RESTRICTED`. See the [error handling guide](doc:js-agent#error-handling) for more details.
- A new `load()` option in the NPM package of JS agent: `scriptUrlPattern`. See more details in the [JS agent guide](doc:js-agent#agent-initialization).
