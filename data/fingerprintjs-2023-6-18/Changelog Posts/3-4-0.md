- Makes `get` run much faster when some time passes between calling `load()` and `get()`. See the [JavaScript agent preloading guide](doc:js-agent-preloading) to learn how to leverage it.
- Added an error constant for bad server response format: `FingerprintJS.ERROR_BAD_RESPONSE_FORMAT`. The error can be caused by wrong endpoint.
- The `disableTls` option is moved from the `get` options to the `load` options. It still works when set within `get` options for compatibility, but doesn't actually disable the TLS request. So we recommend updating your code if you use `disableTls`.
- fix: JS agent may never complete getting the visitor identifier when the page is in background.
